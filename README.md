# Internet Of Things

## Introduction
This training is aimed to who want to start with internet of things, is not an advance training or similar. I will cover some topics from my point of view and try to create a useful set of concepts. I will create a project to be sure that I don't miss any concept, from the ideation to the implementation. So.. my name is Juan Pablo Pizarro and you can find my professional profile at [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanpablopizarro/).

The training is all about internet of things so we need a project in mind to see the progress and for that I'm thinking in a tool for automatic irrigation system but you can go with your own ideas if you have some features in common with this training like wifi connection, BLE, OTA and Cloud Computing.
