# Wifi Example

The WiFi libraries provide support for configuring and monitoring the ESP32 WiFi networking functionality. This includes configuration for:

- Station mode (aka STA mode or WiFi client mode). ESP32 connects to an access point.
- AP mode (aka Soft-AP mode or Access Point mode). Stations connect to the ESP32.
- Combined AP-STA mode (ESP32 is concurrently an access point and a station connected to another access point).
- Various security modes for the above (WPA, WPA2, WEP, etc.)
- Scanning for access points (active & passive scanning).
- Promiscuous mode for monitoring of IEEE802.11 WiFi packets.

In this project we will connect to Wifi throught the ESP32, so we will be using the ESP32 in WiFi client mode.

The code in python is as follows:
```python
import network
 
    ssid = "yourNetworkName"
    password =  "yourNetworkPassword"
 
    station = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
 
    if station.isconnected() == True:
        print("Already connected")
        return
 
    station.active(True)
    station.connect(ssid, password)
 
    while station.isconnected() == False:
        pass
 
    print("Connection successful")
    print(station.ifconfig())
```
Save it as "main.py" and upload it to the ESP32 board.

The code in c++ is as follows:
```cpp
#include "WiFi.h"
 
const char* ssid = "yourNetworkName";
const char* password =  "yourNetworkPass";
 
void setup() {
 
  Serial.begin(115200);
 
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
 
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi..");
  }
 
  Serial.println("Connected to the WiFi network");
 
}
 
void loop() {}
```
